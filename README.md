### HTML VULNERABILITY FIX


The original login form code had a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the username input field. The problem lies in the line where the username value is inserted directly into the HTML without any sanitization.

```document.body.innerHTML += `<p>Welcome, ${username}!</p>`;

This could allow an attacker to execute scripts in other users' browsers, compromising the security of the application.


To address this vulnerability, an escape function has been introduced that sanitizes special characters in the username before inserting them into the DOM. 
1. Use the encodeHTML function to convert special characters into safe HTML entities.

```javascript
function encodeHTML(str) {
    return str.replace(/&/g, '&amp;')
              .replace(/</g, '&lt;')
              .replace(/>/g, '&gt;')
              .replace(/"/g, '&quot;')
              .replace(/'/g, '&#39;');
}
