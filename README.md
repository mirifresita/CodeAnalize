###  Hardcoding vulnerability
 There is a significant security vulnerability related to hardcoding credentials in the client-side JavaScript.
 ```javascript
 if (username === 'admin' && password === 'admin123') {
    alert('Login successful!');
} else {
    alert('Invalid credentials!');
} 
```
## Vulnerability Details
- Hardcoded Credentials: The username and password ('admin' and 'admin123') are hardcoded in the client-side script. This means that anyone with access to the webpage can view the source code and easily find these credentials.

- Client-Side Authentication: Authentication is performed entirely on the client side. This approach is fundamentally insecure because all logic is exposed to the user. An attacker can bypass the login process by modifying the JavaScript code directly in their browser console.

**To secure the application, the vulnerable code should be removed and proper server-side authentication should be implemented.**
