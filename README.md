### Vulnerability in Using Local Storage
The code presents a critical vulnerability related to the use of Local Storage to store user credentials (username and password). Local Storage is a feature of HTML5 that allows web applications to store data locally within the user's browser without a defined expiration date.



Specific Issues with Local Storage:

- Local Storage does not provide any encryption or protection for the stored data. Any data saved in Local Storage is accessible to any script running on the same web page.
- If an attacker manages to execute malicious scripts on the same page (through a Cross-Site Scripting attack, for instance), they can access and steal the stored credentials.
- Data in Local Storage persists even after the browser tab or the browser itself is closed. This means that if a device is compromised, the credentials can be accessible to an attacker.

**The safest way to address this vulnerability is to eliminate the use of Local Storage for storing credentials.**
