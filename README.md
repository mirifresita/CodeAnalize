###ABOUT THE CODE 

This code represents a simple web page with a login form and some JavaScript functionality.

The main purpose of this code is to provide a basic login form on a web page. When a user enters a username and password and clicks the login button, the code checks if the entered credentials match the default credentials ('admin' and 'admin123'). If they match, it shows a successful login message; otherwise, it shows an invalid credentials message. Additionally, it saves the credentials in the browser's local storage and displays a personalized welcome message on the page.

However, this code is vulnerable to security attacks as it stores credentials in plain text in the browser's local storage, which could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access. Also, the validation of credentials is performed on the client-side, which can be easily manipulated. Therefore, this code should not be used in production environments without additional security measures.
